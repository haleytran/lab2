                        To
                    think
                 in only
              two colors:
              Black and
              White. To be  oblivious                    to all 
             others. only black. or                   white.Or
               shallow or  deep, high               or low,agree
             or fight I only   think in            black or white.
            Have  you finished   your                 job? No?
           Then  you  must  not    have                 even  tried
          at  all. How  was your                           day? Terrible?
          No?  Then  it  must                                   very
         much  have  been quite                                  the
         ball.I ask what color                                    is the 
         grass  If not green,         then             it          must
         be  red. I ask  how         your             mother       is? If
          not well, she must       be dead.            What is     8 over
           2equivalent to?If        not 4               then      it must 
            be minus 4. Is it                                    me that you
               love and adore?            If not, then I        must be the 
                one you abhor. I           think in two        dimensions I see
               both length and width.         Depth          is a mystery To me, a
              myth. Like a paper I have                    but two sides. Each time you
      see      just one face Its blank stare is one you      cannot erase. BUT! what
     if I had     finished the job halfway and my day          had just been okay. The
      grass looks   like a dead yellow and I hear         your mother feels quite 
     mellow. What   if one had changed divid-                  ends And rather than 
    lover, we were.   just friends. These are           the       truly unique colors of 
      life. This is where identity and variety     are rife. With amethyst, bronze,
                      cerulean, and deep pink.     Ecru, flam ingo, indigo and pitch
                    like ink. Do not think there     is just wr ong and right For we
                     cannot think in only black            and white. Do not fall
                  for any extremist propoganda.           For we are not as 
    
                          monochrome as an innocent small panda.
